### _Upper Arm Wearable for physiotherapy applications_

Amaru Maki is an upper arm wearable for physiotherapy sessions. The wearable measures the Range of Motion (ROM) of three arm joints: the elbow flexion-extension, wrist flexion-extension, and wrist pronation-supination. It communicates wirelessly through a graphical interface which displays in real-time the movement of each joint.
